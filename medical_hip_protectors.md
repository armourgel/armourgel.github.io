A frustratingly common injury amongst the elderly is fracture of the hip occasioned by a fall. It is known that on any one day 20% of orthopaedic hospital beds in Northern Europe are occupied by sufferers of hip fracture. There is therefore an unsatisfied demand for either a regime that minimises the likelihood of injury, or a device that reduces the chance of fracture resulting from a fall.

Our engineers have identified an unmet need for a flexible, comfortable, unobtrusive protector for this market. The main challenge in the development of hip protectors has been to create a device that is user-friendly, which is comfortable yet discreet, whilst providing adequate protection.

This medical application is one of the most demanding for an energy absorbing technology, as the ‘device’ needs to be worn on a daily basis, for significant time periods. Many of the systems available today are passive systems that do not provide the user with adequate performance, they are also uncomfortable and cumbersome because they are stiff, inflexible and do not allow the skin to breath, which results in many people choosing not to wear them, and risking injury.

###Armourgel is the Answer

Armourgel, the flexible system that has been developed to be incorporated directly into a garment to protect the human body against impact, is the perfect material to be used in the manufacture of medical hip protectors. This revolutionary energy absorbing material stiffens upon impact to provide protection, but will flex with the musculature of the body when protection is not required, thus combining safety with comfort.

Armourgel© technology allows for a comfortable and unobtrusive design, that is  breathable, up to four times thinner, and more flexible than existing products. The system has already found its place in protection for motorcyclists, but remains unique in the market place and offers the potential to make a significant contribution in the ever growing clinical field of fracture and injury prevention.

Armourgel is tuneable to both the speed and frequency in the strain rate of a specific hazard. The Armourgel technology can be easily fabricated in any geometry, and it is now possible to build auxetic features into this system, which act to improve the response to impact.
