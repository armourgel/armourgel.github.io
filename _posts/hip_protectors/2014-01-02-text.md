###Armourgel is the Answer

Armourgel, the flexible system that has been developed to be incorporated directly into a garment to protect the human body against impact, is the perfect material to be used in the manufacture of medical hip protectors. This revolutionary energy absorbing material stiffens upon impact to provide protection, but will flex with the musculature of the body when protection is not required, thus combining safety with comfort.

ArmourgelÂ© technology allows for a comfortable and unobtrusive design, that is  breathable, up to four times thinner, and more flexible than existing products. The system has already found its place in protection for motorcyclists, but remains unique in the market place and offers the potential to make a significant contribution in the ever growing clinical field of fracture and injury prevention.

Armourgel is tuneable to both the speed and frequency in the strain rate of a specific hazard. The Armourgel technology can be easily fabricated in any geometry, and it is now possible to build auxetic features into this system, which act to improve the response to impact.
