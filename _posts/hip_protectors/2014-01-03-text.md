A frustratingly common injury amongst the elderly is fracture of the hip occasioned by a fall. It is known that on any one day 20% of orthopaedic hospital beds in Northern Europe are occupied by sufferers of hip fracture. There is therefore an unsatisfied demand for either a regime that minimises the likelihood of injury, or a device that reduces the chance of fracture resulting from a fall.

Our engineers have identified an unmet need for a flexible, comfortable, unobtrusive protector for this market. The main challenge in the development of hip protectors has been to create a device that is user-friendly, which is comfortable yet discreet, whilst providing adequate protection.

This medical application is one of the most demanding for an energy absorbing technology, as the ‘device’ needs to be worn on a daily basis, for significant time periods. Many of the systems available today are passive systems that do not provide the user with adequate performance, they are also uncomfortable and cumbersome because they are stiff, inflexible and do not allow the skin to breath, which results in many people choosing not to wear them, and risking injury.
