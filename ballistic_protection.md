The military and law enforcement markets for ballistic armour continue to grow. The market for ballistic protection in the United States for law enforcement is worth $140 million. It is estimated that this is about a 1/5 of the total US market.

There has recently been more demand for concealable or covert armour that can be worn under normal clothing. The drivers are for thinner, lighter and more comfortable ballistic protection. Todayâ€™s armours are a compromise between comfort and protection. When rated for higher threat levels, they are usually made of many layers of fabric, as well as containing ballistic ceramic plates to protect vital regions against higher energy rifle rounds, which makes them bulky, heavy and stiff. In addition, the thick fabrics do not allow for good air circulation, which can lead to debilitating heat stress if an effective cooling system is not implemented. Even armour, suited for lower threat levels, such as everyday police use, is regarded as uncomfortable to wear for extended periods.

Currently, lighter weight ballistic protection is possible from a range of materials. Today most of these soft armours are manufactured from multilayer high strength fibres, quilted together to form the ballistic pack. Advances in high strength fibres are ongoing, but our engineers have developed a way to reduce the mass of the ballistic pack, with the addition of our innovative new material, Armourgel.

Although the personal ballistic armour currently used by police forces and the military reduces injuries caused by gunshots, the wearer can still sustain serious injuries, including broken ribs and damage to internal organs. Although the projectile does not pass through the armour, injuries can be caused by a pressure wave transmitted into the body from the impact.

###The Customer Need

The continued advancement in ballistic armour is leading to the development of body armour which addresses the current demands for improved comfort, lower weight, greater flexibility and most importantly, better ballistic protection. Yet again the answer lies with Armourgel technology.
