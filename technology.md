Armourgel is a revolutionary new energy absorbing material, designed to alter the way we think about protecting the human body from impact and injury. Gone are the days of bulky, uncomfortable, often heavy, body-worn protection, this new generation material may be incorporated directly into a garment to shield against impacts and abrasions. The innovative design of this new system means that it can flex with the musculature of the body when it is not needed, but immediately stiffens and becomes rigid upon impact, to provide protection when it is needed. As well as being comfortable and soft when not in use, it is also breathable, essential for wearers of protective clothing engaged in physical activity.

Armourgel is even self-healing, designed to absorb and recover from multiple impacts without suffering any damage. Rigorous testing also shows that it can handle being subjected to repeated impacts without compromise to the wearer’s safety. The harder or faster you fall, the better it works.

Because Armourgel has been developed to suit those with an active outdoor lifestyle, it has been refined to handle different climates and weather, so it is waterproof and does not suffer any degradation of performance at extremes of temperature, coping with -20 degrees right up to 50 degrees Celsius.

Our engineers have fine-tuned this innovative material over the last five years, to provide protective, comfortable and durable apparel for three very different market areas. In each instance protective garments and armour made and tested with the Armourgel material have succeeded in significantly improving upon the comfort and safety of many products already on the market in each field, products that do not have the benefit of Armourgel’s unique mechanical and structural properties.

Armourgel materials are already proven to be effective in the sporting goods sector. Limb and back protectors incorporating Armourgel are leading the market in performance and are up to 50% thinner than existing solutions. The Armourgel material currently passes and exceeds the two European standards covering motorcyclists' protective clothing against mechanical impact, so it is clear that we never compromise on safety.

Due to its unique mechanical and structural properties, this ‘smart’ material has the potential to increase the affordability and effectiveness of protective wear in not only sporting arenas, where it has already enjoyed great success and acclamation, but in the military field, where it can provide protection in the form of body-armour used in defence of ballistic weaponry, and also in the medical sector where we have demonstrated its many properties make it the perfect material to use in the manufacture hip protectors for the elderly, to prevent the serious risk of fracture.
